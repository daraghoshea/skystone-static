This 300-key hotel, when built, was the tallest modular hotel in North America. Skystone Group LLC was involved on this project since inception, including training two general contractors and their subcontractors in the modular application and delineation of scope. 

The project was the first of its kind in the city and includes 14 unique module types, a staircase module and all exterior fa√ßade components. The project was completed under steel cage production in Poland and shipped to NYC for installation.

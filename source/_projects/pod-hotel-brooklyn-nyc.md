All modules for this hotel have been delivered to the port of Red Hook in Brooklyn, New York. This 251 key hotel was installed at Williamsburg in May 2016. With support from Garrison Architects, developers Ironstate and SK Developments, the modular application will be the first of its kind for the POD Hotel owners as a key addition to their brand expansion. The POD Hotel, although simplistic in appearance, consists of 151 modules and with 93 unique modular types posed a considerable logistical challenge.

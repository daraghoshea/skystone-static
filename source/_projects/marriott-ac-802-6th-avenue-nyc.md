The 168-room, 26-story *Marriott AC* Hotel New York (842 Sixth Avenue) will be the **world’s tallest modular hotel** when completed. Currently under construction, the hotel’s design features prefabricated hotel room units that arrive (fully complete) at the hotel site before being lifted into place by crane. 

Each steel module contains one fully outfitted guest room – pre-painted, decorated and outfitted with beds, bedding, and flooring. The hotel’s roof and rooftop bar are also constructed off-site, while the hotel’s public areas, such as the restaurant and lobby will be constructed using traditional methods.

**Skystone is the General Contractor as well as Modular Manufacturer for this project.**

This 148-room modular hotel was designed by Lemancheau Architects for The Germain Group and
was completed at the end of 2016 and early 2017.

The hotel consists of 8 stories of modules and 5 basic room variances. In total, there are 92 modules and 32 different module types. The modules came with completed corridors, MEP risers, and a completed rooftop, which was the first of its kind to be installed in Canada at this scale.
